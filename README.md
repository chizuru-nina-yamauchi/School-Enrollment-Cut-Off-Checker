# Exercise 10 (Hard):
## Overview:
You are a software engineer at a company that manages a school. The school has a policy that if a student is born after a certain date, they cannot enroll in the current academic year.

The cut-off date is 1st September of the current academic year.

## Step Guidance:

2. Take the student's birth date and the current date as input.
3. Convert the input into LocalDate objects.
